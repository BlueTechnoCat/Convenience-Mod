# Convenience-Mod

Because you can't have too much convenience

This repo is to add those ideas that you want in the game but you don't want to be screamed at by the usual people in the [Mindustry-Suggestions](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions) Repo

> [!NOTE]
> This mod adds mostly blocks that use the items and liquids already in the game, so no new items or liquids will be added.
