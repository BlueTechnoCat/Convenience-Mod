# TODO List (Ideas By [dennisjosh16](https://github.com/dennisjosh16))

## Distribution

- [ ] Titanium, Plastanium, Phase and Surge Routers and Junctions

    - [ ] Titanium Router and Junction: No Brainer, faster and bulkier Router and junction
    - [ ] Plastanium Router and Juncton: Faster than the previous one, Absorbs Lasers
    - [ ] Phase Router and Junction: Even Faster, Can deflect Bullets
    - [ ] Surge Router and Junction: Instant transfer, Generates Lightning when hit

- [ ] Titanium, Plastanium, Phase and Surge Liquid Routers and Liquid Junctions

    - [ ] Same as above but with liquid routers and liquid junctions 

- [ ] Router Randomizer: One item comes in, another one comes out (ex: Copper in, lead out; Thorium in Surge out, etc ) 

- [ ] Omega Distributor: 11x11 Router that uses power (let's say 3 power/s)

- [ ] Solar Power Router and Liquid Router: Works like a solar panel and a router at the same time ([Deltanedas already did this](https://github.com/DeltaNedas/routorio/blob/master/content/blocks/power/solar-router.json))

## Drills

- [ ] Excavator: Can extract different materials from the floor (Only raw material no composite ones)

- [ ] Surge Alloy Excavator: Extracts surge from the floor every seven(7) seconds or so

- [ ] Slag Extractor: Like a water extractor but for Slag

- [ ] Cryofluid Extractor: Like a water extractor but for Cryofluid (Requires snow, ice or ice-snow tiles)

## Walls

- [ ] Shielded Walls (All Tiers): Walls with shields, uses power, from copper to surge (Only large ones)

- [ ] Slag Wall: Explodes in a slag poll after being destroyed

- [ ] Tar Wall: Explodes in a tar poll atfer being destroyed

## Extras (AKA Traps)

- [ ] Pit Trap: insta kills T1 and T2 ground units who fall here (Doesn't affect leg units)

- [ ] EMP Mine: Turns off units and blocks nearby (from the opossite team)

- [ ] Bear Trap: Traps and damage a unit for a few seconds

- [ ] Oil Barrel: Explodes with tar and a small flame

- [ ] Flash Mine: Confuses enemys for a moment
